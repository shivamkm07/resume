    \begin{cvitems}
 \item Implemented SOTA algorithm FastTrack for Task Parallel Programs, using \textbf{LLVM} pass for memory instrumentation
 \item Created an \textbf{optimized} form of FastTrack called FastRacer, reducing space as well as time complexity of detector
  % of metadata operations making it execute on all real-world benchmarks
 \item Designed  \textbf{novel} algorithm Tasker by
 integrating 
 \textbf{vector clocks}
  with space efficient
%  a popular
 tree-based techniques
%  PTracer
%  with the cheap
  % data race checking of
   
%  -based FastRacer
 \item FastRacer achieved speedup of \textbf{1.46X} and Tasker \textbf{1.48X} on 128GB-Intel Xeon system with PTRacer as baseline
 
% and Tasker outperformed PTRacer by \textbf{1.46X}
% 
% Outperformed PTRacer by \textbf{1.5X} on a 128GB-Intel Xeon system, 1.3X on two another Intel Xeon and I9-9900 systems
%  \item Paper based on the research work is under review

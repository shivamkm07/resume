 \item Implemented a SOTA algorithm FastTrack for Task Parallel Programs, using \textbf{LLVM} pass for memory instrumentation
 \item Created an \textbf{optimized} form of FastTrack called FastRacer by reducing space as well as time overhead of metadata operations making it execute on all real-world benchmarks
 \item Designed a \textbf{novel} algorithm Tasker by integrating the space efficiency of a popular tree-based technique PTracer with the cheap data race checking of \textbf{vector-clock}-based FastRacer
 \item FastRacer achieved speedup of \textbf{1.46X} and Tasker \textbf{1.48X} on 128GB-Intel Xeon system with PTRacer as baseline
 
% and Tasker outperformed PTRacer by \textbf{1.46X}
% 
% Outperformed PTRacer by \textbf{1.5X} on a 128GB-Intel Xeon system, 1.3X on two another Intel Xeon and I9-9900 systems
 \item Paper based on the research work is under review
